"""
Revolut investment data parser (optional input).

Reads any ``input/revolut/*.csv`` file, keeps only the rows for the security
tracked by the rest of the engine, and turns them into the engine's native
:class:`StockEvent` / :class:`SavingsIncomeYear` objects so they flow into the
*same* FIFO pool as the E-Trade data (cross-broker FIFO + 2-month wash-sale, as
Spain requires for homogeneous securities).

Two export shapes are auto-detected per file:

* **Account movements** (preferred) — a full transaction log with columns
  ``Date, Ticker, Type, Quantity, Price per share, Total Amount, Currency,
  FX Rate``. This includes ``BUY``/``SELL`` trades, normalizes ``STOCK SPLIT``
  rows into post-split share terms, and ignores cash top-ups, withdrawals and
  internal transfers. It has **no ISIN**, so rows are filtered by
  **Ticker**. Crucially it carries *buys* too, so a security you bought but never
  sold on Revolut still enters the FIFO pool.

* **Realized gains/losses** — already-FIFO-matched sells with columns
  ``Date acquired, Date sold, Symbol, ISIN, ..., Cost basis, Gross proceeds``
  (with or without an ``Income from Sells`` / ``Other income & fees`` section
  header). Filtered by **ISIN** when available, else ticker. The "Other income &
  fees" section, when present, becomes dividend/withholding (RCM) income.

Currency: only USD (converted via the official ECB rate per transaction date,
like the E-Trade data) and EUR (1:1) are processed; other currencies are skipped
with a warning. Revolut's own ``FX Rate`` column is intentionally ignored —
Spanish tax law uses the ECB reference rate, which the engine fetches itself.
